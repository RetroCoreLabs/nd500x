# PMOF - Pmof

## Overview

**Mnemonic:** `pmof`
**Function:** Pmof
**Class:** SYSTEM
**Privilege:** user

**Format:** `PMOF`

---

## Description

Privileged instruction. Following instruction accesses will be interpreted directly as physical addresses, rather than being mapped on a physical segment through the memory management system. The physical address of the next instruction to be executed is found in the L register. If the program memory management system is already turned off, control is transferred to the physical address specified by the L register and the instruction has no further effect.

**Operands:** 0
**Variants:** 1 opcode(s)

## Variants

Total variants: 1

| Variant | Opcode | Prefix | Register | Addressing Modes |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|------------------|
| 1/1 | 0xFF19 | - | 1 | ALL |

---

## Operands

This instruction takes no operands.
---

## Trap Conditions

- **OPERAND_ERROR (Bit 5):** Invalid addressing mode or alignment

[Additional trap conditions based on instruction type]

---

## Data Status Bits

- **Z (Zero):** [Effect on zero flag]
- **S (Sign):** [Effect on sign flag]
- **O (Overflow):** [Effect on overflow flag]
- **K (Flag):** [Effect on K flag]
